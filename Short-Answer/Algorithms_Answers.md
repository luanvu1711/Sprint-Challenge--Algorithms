#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) 0(n) - linear time The algorithim has a liniear time complexity because the time increases in porportion to the input n.

b) 0(n^2) - quadratic time The algorithim needs to perfrom a linear opearation for each input value n so it has quadratic time complexity.

c) 0(n) - linear time The algorithims run time increases linearly with the size of input n.

## Exercise II

To find f. Start From the middle of the building and drop and egg. If it does not brake then set min flor f and recursively call the function to spit the number n in half, it it does brake set max floor and recursively call the function to spit the number n in half.

0(n^2)
